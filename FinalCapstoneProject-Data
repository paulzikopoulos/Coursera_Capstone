I will use Foursquare location data to go and find the business in the Oshawa Durham area that serve Sushi or Greek 
cuisine within a 20 km radius of the city. 

Furthermore, I will look at the user reviews to determine which cuisine has a highly rated vendor or if there is 
a gap there too. Bottom line, I will use the number of competitors, and how good those competitors are at their 
respective cuisine as two main decision criteria to enter either business or none at all.
