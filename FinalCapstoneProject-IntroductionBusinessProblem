I want to open a restaurant in the city of Oshawa and I'm interested in either a Greek restaurant or a Sushi restaurant. 

There seems to be a lot of Sushi restaurants around but I can't be certain and I'd like to know if they are doing a job 
or not based on ratings. 

I will also do the same comparison for Greek cuisine and then decide which venture to invest in, or none of them at all.
